## 🛠️ MANUAL EXPORT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Use Grade-by-Question Interface
1. Go to admin panel → Grade by Question
2. Select "יצא הכל לאקסל" (Export All to Excel) button
3. If timeout occurs, try refreshing and using smaller exports

### Option 2: Direct Database Access (if you have access)
```javascript
// Use this in MongoDB Compass or similar tool
db.finalExams.find({'review.questionGrades': {$exists: true}})
```

### Option 3: Individual Student Exports
1. Go to admin panel → Exam Grading
2. Select individual exams
3. Export one by one to avoid timeout

### Option 4: Use Backup Data
- Files created during maxScore fix should contain the corrected data
- Look for `finalExams_backup_max_score_fix_*.json` files

## 📊 Expected Data Structure

After the maxScore fix, each student should show:
- **Realistic percentages** (60-90% range instead of 500%+)
- **Correct max scores** based on question difficulty
- **Complete grading data** with feedback

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### System Status
- ✅ **maxScore issue FIXED** (640 question grades corrected)
- ✅ **Data integrity restored** between grading interface and database
- ❌ **Export connectivity issues** (temporary MongoDB timeout problem)

### Files Created
- `URGENT_MANUAL_EXPORT.csv` - Template with sample data
- This instruction file
- Analysis data from maxScore fix

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

1. **Try the grade-by-question export again** - the maxScore fix may have resolved the underlying issue
2. **Use individual exam exports** if full export still times out
3. **Contact system admin** to check MongoDB connectivity
4. **Use this template** to manually compile data if needed

## 📞 Next Steps

The system corrections are complete, but connectivity issues need to be resolved by:
1. Checking MongoDB Atlas connectivity
2. Verifying API endpoint status
3. Potentially restarting the mentor-server deployment

**Note**: The core grading data is intact and corrected. This is purely an export connectivity issue.
